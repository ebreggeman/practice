# Practice
Hey Erin:) - README.md is a great place to add notes, setup instructions, etc. 
I'm pretty swamped here for the next few days, but I would like to get this project running locally this weekend so I can give you some fun tasks.
Task 1 I would like to give you is document the setup and how to run and integrate this project (for someone like me who has code access but has not yet built the project). 
I know this seems menial but its a good crash course in understanding what exactly is needed to run a project like this - good luck and let me know if you have issues :)

Hi Sean! I just saw this in here. I will start working on this project later today and this weekend! I think this is a great first task, as I followed a few tutorials and don't necessarily understand what everything even does in these files. So that will give me lots to think about and work on! 
Thank you! 

Of course :) if you ever want to setup a call to be able to get more info/explainations on ANYTHING please feel free, im sitting at home coding most days lol

Thank you, absolutely will do! I decided I could use this task to also practice some of the HTML I've been learning, so I am putting my in-progress guide on this silly little website: https://erinbpractice.w3spaces-preview.com/index.html
I'm still working on getting all the screenshots in there, and I plan to make another guide to link an existing database to Prisma, as well as using Accelerate and Optimize, but this is my rough start. I played around with Github Pages to try to do all of this but got a little stuck, so I'm just using a free platform that allows me to do very basic things for the time being. 
Eventually, I'm thinking I'll try to build a submission form that links right to the database, so the data put into the form goes right into Prisma. I just hit the forms part of my HTML and Javascript tutorials, so I'm sure that'll take some experimenting on my part.
